# Chat System Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Name Question Issue**
**Problem**: When asking "What is my name?", the system was returning the entire resume content instead of just the name.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Moved name question logic to the beginning of the function
- ✅ Enhanced name extraction with multiple patterns
- ✅ Added fallback name extraction from raw text
- ✅ Improved validation to ensure extracted text looks like a name

### 2. **Response Formatting Issues**
**Problem**: Responses were poorly formatted and sometimes too verbose.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added consistent response structure with `source` field
- ✅ Limited fallback responses to prevent entire resume dump
- ✅ Improved text filtering to return only relevant sentences
- ✅ Added response length limits (300 chars max for fallback)

### 3. **Pattern Matching Improvements**
**Problem**: Some questions weren't being caught by the appropriate handlers.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Enhanced education questions to include "study", "school"
- ✅ Enhanced experience questions to include "project", "position"
- ✅ Enhanced skills questions to include "technical"
- ✅ Enhanced contact questions to include "phone"
