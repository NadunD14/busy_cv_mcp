2. **Monitor Usage** - Check your usage at [dashboard.cohere.com](https://dashboard.cohere.com/)
3. **Optimize Prompts** - Clear, specific questions get better answers
4. **Free Tier Monitoring** - Track monthly usage to stay within limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API Key**
   - Ensure you copied the full API key correctly
   - Check that the key is active in your dashboard
   - Make sure the key is in your `.env` file

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Wait a minute and try again
   - Consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher limits

3. **Monthly Limit Reached**
   - Check your usage in the dashboard
   - Either wait for next month or upgrade to paid plan

### Testing Without API Key

The system will automatically fall back to rule-based responses if no API key is provided, so you can still test the basic functionality.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** - Keep `.env` file out of version control
2. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode API keys in source code
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new API keys periodically
4. **Monitor usage** - Watch for unexpected API calls
